# Firebase Silent Failures on Non-Existent Documents and Collections

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Firebase where accessing non-existent documents or collections can lead to unexpected behavior without throwing clear error messages.  The lack of explicit error handling can make debugging challenging.  The `bug.js` file shows how the issue can manifest, and the `bugSolution.js` file provides improved error handling and strategies to prevent silent failures.

## Problem:

The Firebase SDK does not always throw errors when you attempt to access non-existent data.  This can result in unexpected behavior in your application, making debugging complex.

## Solution:

The solution includes explicit checks for existence using `get()` method and checking for empty snapshots or null values. This ensures that you can handle these cases gracefully and prevent your application from crashing unexpectedly.
