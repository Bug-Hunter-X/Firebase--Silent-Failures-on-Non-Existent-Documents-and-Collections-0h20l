The Firebase SDK might throw an error if you try to access a document or collection that doesn't exist. This can lead to unexpected behavior in your application, such as crashes or silent failures.  For example, if you're using the `get()` method on a document reference that doesn't exist, it will return a `null` value, which is not always easy to handle. Similarly, if you use `where` queries with conditions that don't match any documents, the query will return an empty array, and no error will be thrown. This makes it difficult to debug the problem because the issue is not indicated with a clear error.
